# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-of-Airbnb-Dataset
In this project, we focus on price level and its factors. We search for factors which may affect price level air-BnB rooms. 
In order to achieve our goal, we use various methods like tests, formulas, machine learning algorithms, graphs and visualization methods.
We investigate two datasets. We start by describing the datasets. Then by using the first one, we look for a relationship between availability_365 days and price. Our second dataset provides us to detect correlations between price - cancellation policy and price - ratings.
In the end, we state which factor has the greatest impact on price. 
In summary, our problem is understanding the reason behind the difference between prices.
